# Bragi

A general math framework built in C++. 

I'm going to try and follow Google's [Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Testing
```bash
cd build
./build.sh
```

if you do not have cmake installed run:
```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

Currently, there is no attempt to support windows directly, though for an experienced user it shouldn't be hard
